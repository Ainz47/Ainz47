### 🚀 What I'm building
I focus on replacing manual workflows with secure, automated cloud systems that maintain strict data integrity. You can view all my source code in my **[Main Projects Repository](https://github.com/Ainz47/Projects)**:

* ⚙️ **Event-Driven ETLs:** Architecting FastAPI microservices with PostgreSQL idempotent UPSERTs to process asynchronous JSON payloads.
* 📊 **Cloud-Native Engines:** Decoupling business logic for automated PDF generation via Python, Jinja2, and WeasyPrint.
* 🛰️ **Hardware-to-Cloud (IoT):** Fusing Magnetometer & Ultrasonic sensors on ESP32 nodes using LoRa telemetry for real-time monitoring.
* 🕷️ **Advanced Data Acquisition:** Bypassing enterprise WAFs (Incapsula/Cloudflare) and utilizing CDP session hijacking for high-fidelity extraction.

### 🛠️ Core Tech Stack
* **Backend & Data:** Python (Advanced), FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Supabase, Pandas.
* **Automation:** Playwright, REST APIs, Webhooks, Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP).
* **Hardware Logic:** ESP32, LoRa, Combinational Systems Design.
